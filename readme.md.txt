# Windows survival

I did migrate from OSX to Windows 10 - as I did years ago from Windows XP to OSX - but now it feels painful.

In addition I have used several years RHEL at work and know that OS can just work. Nothing fancy, but stable.

Let's see how long I manage with my XPS 15 before I format whole Win 10 over and install Linux.

# Installations take ages? 

Use package manager

install scoop

# Where is Bash?

Install WLS (windows linux subsystem)
